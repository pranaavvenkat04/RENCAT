- A NASA Prototype that utilizes a novel laser vibrometer sensor for monitoring cardiac activities remotely and non-invasively, specifically heart functions of valve/chamber opening and closing cycles (cardiac cycles)
- Designed software that analyzes and filters the readings from an interferometer and developed a program that uses cardiac data to mimic a heartbeat on a speaker- A NASA Prototype that utilizes a novel laser vibrometer sensor for monitoring cardiac activities remotely and non-invasively, specifically heart functions of valve/chamber opening and closing cycles (cardiac cycles) - Designed software that analyzes and filters the readings from an interferometer and developed a program that uses cardiac data to mimic a heartbeat on a speaker
